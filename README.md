### Bookworm 

## Insert table of contents

## Summary
As an avid reader, I constantly add books to my to-be-read list. This list is usually a notepad on my phone. It can take months or years before you return to a title. By that point, the name of the book or author is often forgotten.

This is where Bookworm comes in. 

Bookworm allows you to keep a book list with the name, author, genre, and a picture of the cover.  Now you can look through your book list and have all the details you need to choose your next read.

Have fun keeping a book list, with Bookworm!
